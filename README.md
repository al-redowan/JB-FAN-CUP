# Esports Teams Directory Website

This repository contains the code for a simple, user-friendly website designed to list and display esports teams organized into various groups. The website is built using core web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsive layout, and JavaScript for interactive features like a real-time search functionality.

## Description

The Esports Teams Directory website provides an organized overview of esports teams, categorized into different groups (e.g., Group g, Group h, etc.). Each team entry includes its name, email, and associated username. The site is designed with a clean UI/UX, ensuring it's accessible and easy to navigate on various devices.

## Features

*   **Team Listing:** Displays a comprehensive list of esports teams across different predefined groups.
*   **Grouped Organization:** Teams are clearly segmented into their respective groups for easy browsing.
*   **Detailed Information:** Each team card shows the team name, email address, and username.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing a consistent experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
*   **Search Functionality:** An integrated search bar allows users to quickly find specific teams by typing their names, with results updating in real-time.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean design with clear typography, intuitive navigation, and subtle visual cues.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For structuring the web content semantically.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, layout (including responsive grid design), and visual presentation.
*   **JavaScript:** For implementing interactive features, specifically the team search functionality.

## File Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file containing all the website's content and structure.
*   `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for the website's visual appearance, layout, and responsiveness.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file that adds interactivity, primarily the search functionality.

## Setup and Usage

To view the website, simply follow these steps:

1.  **Download/Save the Files:**
    *   Save the HTML code provided as `index.html`.
    *   Save the CSS code provided as `style.css`.
    *   Save the JavaScript code provided as `script.js`.
    *   **Crucially, ensure all three files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are saved in the same directory/folder.**

2.  **Open in Browser:**
    *   Locate the `index.html` file in your file explorer.
    *   Open `index.html` with your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

The website should now be visible and fully functional.

## How to Use the Search

1.  Once the website is open, you will see a search bar at the top.
2.  Start typing the name of the team you are looking for into the search bar.
3.  As you type, the list of teams will automatically filter, displaying only those teams whose names match your input.
4.  To see all teams again, clear the search bar.
